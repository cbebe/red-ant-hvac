This will be a repo for the project which I create a website for my uncle's HVAC business.

This is a branch where i just make the set up with Jekyll for static website to begin with (since it's simple enough I guess)

## secret files

Any files in the _data folder starting with `secret_` will not be pushed to the repo. All files contain secret-related information (forms endpoint, api-keys, db-credentials, etc.) will be in such format.

To keep this from getting out of hand, I'll just list the file name and the content of the file here:

### secret_services.yml

A file containing third-party services that I use for this project. Currently, it only contains the endpoint for the *formspree* service.
